# Dog-Years
Calculate your age in dog years 🐶

This is a simple calculator application, no real frontend as of yet (I will work on this) but you change the first variable yourself to calculate your age in dog years. 
First two years count as 10.5 then all count as 4 thereafter as you can see in the code.

Created to help me learn vanilla javascript.
